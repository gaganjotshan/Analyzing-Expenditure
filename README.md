## Project Overview and Objectives

This project aims to assist management in creating and establishing new structures and models to reduce costs by leveraging data mining techniques on the NITI Aayog dataset (1980-81 to 2015-16).

Key Objectives:
1. **Cost Management**: Develop strategies and models to reduce operational costs.
2. **Data Extraction and Transformation**: Perform ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) on the dataset provided by NITI Aayog, covering the period from 1980-81 to 2015-16.
3. **Data Mining**: Analyze the dataset to uncover valuable insights and information.
4. **Key Metrics Identification**: Identify key metrics and factors that influence costs.
5. **Relationship Analysis**: Show meaningful relationships between different attributes within the dataset.
6. **Research and Findings**: Conduct independent research to support findings and provide actionable recommendations.
