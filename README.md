## Project Overview and Objectives

The complete project is being made as a part of Data Science Internship at iNeuron.ai.

This advanced-level project in the Finance domain focuses on Business Intelligence to help organizations manage their costs effectively.
In today's competitive market, effective cost management is crucial for business survival. High revenues alone are insufficient if costs remain unchecked.
This project aims to assist management in creating and establishing new structures and models to reduce costs by leveraging data mining techniques on the NITI Aayog dataset.

### Key Objectives:
1. **Cost Management**: Develop strategies and models to reduce operational costs.
2. **Data Extraction and Transformation**: Perform ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) on the dataset provided by NITI Aayog.
3. **Data Mining**: Analyze the dataset to uncover valuable insights and information.
4. **Key Metrics Identification**: Identify key metrics and factors that influence costs.
5. **Relationship Analysis**: Show meaningful relationships between different attributes within the dataset.
6. **Research and Findings**: Conduct independent research to support findings and provide actionable recommendations.

### Scope of Work:
- ETL Process: Extract, transform, and load data
- Data Mining: Explore dataset, identify patterns and trends
- Key Metrics Identification: Determine cost impact factors
- Relationship Analysis: Uncover correlations and causations
- Research and Findings: Validate and present actionable insights

## Data Sources, Installation and Setup

The primary data source for this project is scraped from NITI Aayog website.

## Team and Communication

Data Analyst Intern: Gaganjot Kaur SHAN

Supporting Team: iNeuron Data Science Team


## Quality Assurance and Risk Management

### Quality Assurance:
- Implement code review process for all analysis scripts
- Use version control for all code and documentation
- Conduct peer review of all analytical findings
- Perform sensitivity analysis on key results
- Validate all models with test datasets
- Ensure all visualizations are clear, accurate, and properly labeled

### Risk Management:
- Data Quality: Implement robust cleaning and validation processes
- Scope Creep: Clearly define project boundaries, implement change control
- Technical Challenges: Allocate buffer time, ensure access to technical support
- Stakeholder Expectations: Regular communication and alignment meetings

## Conclusion and Future Scope

### Conclusion:
This project aims to provide valuable insights into cost management through data mining and analysis of historical data. By identifying key metrics and relationships, the project will offer actionable recommendations to help the business reduce costs and improve overall efficiency. The comprehensive approach, combining data analysis, visualization, and strategic recommendations, will provide a solid foundation for informed decision-making and cost-optimization strategies.

### Future Scope:
- Potential integration with real-time cost data streams
- Expansion of the analysis to include additional datasets or business units
- Development of a predictive model for future cost optimization
- Creation of an interactive tool for ongoing cost management
