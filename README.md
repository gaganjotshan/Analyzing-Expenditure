## Project Description
Cost Management and Data Mining for Business Optimization

## Project Overview
In today's competitive market, effective cost management is crucial for business survival. High revenues alone are insufficient if costs remain unchecked. This project aims to assist management in creating and establishing new structures and models to reduce costs by leveraging data mining techniques.

## Objectives
1. **Cost Management**: Develop strategies and models to reduce operational costs.
2. **Data Extraction and Transformation**: Perform ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) on the dataset provided by NITI Aayog, covering the period from 1980-81 to 2015-16.
3. **Data Mining**: Analyze the dataset to uncover valuable insights and information.
4. **Key Metrics Identification**: Identify key metrics and factors that influence costs.
5. **Relationship Analysis**: Show meaningful relationships between different attributes within the dataset.
6. **Research and Findings**: Conduct independent research to support findings and provide actionable recommendations.

## Scope of Work

### ETL Process:
- **Extract**: Retrieve the dataset from the NITI Aayog website.
- **Transform**: Clean and preprocess the data to ensure it is suitable for analysis.
- **Load**: Store the transformed data in a suitable database or data warehouse for easy access and analysis.

### Data Mining:
- Utilize data mining techniques to explore the dataset.
- Identify patterns, trends, and anomalies that can provide insights into cost management.
